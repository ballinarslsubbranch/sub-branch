# Charity self-evaluation: Meeting obligations as a registered charity

*(NOTE: This is for your charity's own use and records. Do not submit
it to the ACNC.)*

This self-evaluation helps you assess whether your charity is meeting
its obligations and helps you identify issues that may prevent it from
doing so.

It asks a series of simple questions and prompts you to describe the
practical steps your charity is taking to meet its obligations.

It provides space for you to note any issues that you identify,
encouraging you to create an action plan to address them.

## What the self-evaluation covers

The self-evaluation comprises 10 short parts that cover each of the [ACNC's 6 Governance Standards](https://acnc.govcms.gov.au/for-charities/manage-your-charity/governance-hub/governance-standards)
and a charity's other [obligations to the ACNC](https://acnc.govcms.gov.au/for-charities/manage-your-charity/obligations-acnc).

### Governance Standards:

-  **Governance Standard 1:** Purposes and not-for-profit nature

-  **Governance Standard 2:** Accountability to members

-  **Governance Standard 3:** Compliance with Australian laws

-  **Governance Standard 4:** Suitability of Responsible Persons

-  **Governance Standard 5:** Duties of Responsible Persons

-  **Governance Standard 6:** Maintaining and Enhancing Public Trust
  and Confidence in the Australian Not-For-Profit Sector

The Governance Standards are principle based and set a minimum level of
governance. It is the responsibility of each charity to decide how it
will meet the Standards based on its size, complexity and the nature of
its operations.

### Other obligations:

-  **Record-keeping**

-  **Reporting**

-  **Duty to notify**

### Completing the self-evaluation

Go through each section in the self-evaluation and respond to the
questions and statements about your charity in the columns.

Describe what your charity does or has done to ensure it is meeting its
obligations.

Make a note of the action it needs to take to improve in specific areas.
Create an action plan based on these notes. There is a template action
plan to help you with this.

*Do not send this self-evaluation back to the ACNC.*

The self-evaluation is a way of checking your charity's compliance with
its obligations. Once you complete the it, share it with people in your
charity -- particularly the Responsible People -- and keep it as part of
your charity's records. Revisit it regularly as part of reviews of your
charity's compliance.

## Before you begin

First check that the information the ACNC has about your charity is
correct and up to date. Do this by looking at the charity's record on
[the Charity Register](https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity) and in [the
Charity Portal](https://charity.acnc.gov.au). If details are missing or
incorrect, provide the information or correct the details in the Charity
Portal.

When going through the self-evaluation, consider your charity's unique
circumstances and ask yourself:

-  **What does the charity do?** Think about its objects, its
  activities and programs, and where it provides its services.

-  **Who is involved?** Think about the people your charity comes into
  contact with, including beneficiaries, volunteers, employees and
  contractors.

-  **How is it managed?** Think about the mix of skills and experience
  of the Responsible People, how decisions are made, and how the
  charity is funded.

-  **What are the risks most relevant to the charity's work?** Think
  about the risks the charity needs to manage. For example, it might
  encounter risks associated with operating overseas, working with
  vulnerable people, or working with partners to deliver services.

It might be useful to have a copy of your charity's governing document
and other documents that outline its activities, programs and operations
too.

## Self-evaluation as a guide

The questions and examples in this self-evaluation are intended as a
guide only because each charity's circumstances are unique. This
self-evaluation should not be read as a compulsory or comprehensive list
of requirements. And while answering 'no' to any one question doesn't
necessarily indicate that your charity is not complying with
obligations, it should prompt a look at the charity's compliance within
its wider circumstances.

## Part 1: Governance Standard 1 -- Purposes and not-for-profit nature

[Governance Standard 1](http://www.acnc.gov.au/GovStd1)
requires your charity to be a not-for-profit and work towards its
[charitable purpose](http://www.acnc.gov.au/charitablepurpose).

All your charity's funds and assets are charitable funds and must be
applied solely to further your charity's purposes. The use of funds and
assets must be permitted by the charity's [governing document](http://www.acnc.gov.au/governingdocument) (often
called a constitution, rules or a trust deed).

This does not preclude your charity from keeping money in reserve,
investing funds, undertaking commercial activities or spending funds on
administration if these activities further the charity's purposes.

Your charity must not use its funds or assets to provide a personal gain
or private benefit to particular people -- for example, members, the
people who run the charity, their friends or relatives.

## Part 2: Governance Standard 2 Accountability to members

[Governance Standard 2](http://www.acnc.gov.au/GovStd2)
requires your charity to be accountable to its members and allow
adequate opportunity for members to raise concerns about how your
charity is run. When your charity is transparent and open to members
about its activities and finances, members will be in a position to
understand the charity's operations and raise questions about its
governance.

NOTE: Governance Standard 2 only applies to charities with members. A
charity's legal structure (for example, an incorporated association,
company limited by guarantee or unincorporated association) and
governing document will determine whether it has members. **If your

## Part 3: Governance Standard 3 -- Compliance with Australian laws

Like all Australians, your charity must comply with Australian law. [Governance Standard
3](http://www.acnc.gov.au/GovStd3) requires your charity to not act in a way that, under Commonwealth, state or territory law, could be dealt with as:

-  an indictable offence (a serious crime generally tried by a judge
  and jury), or

-  a breach of law that has a civil (not criminal) penalty of 60

## Part 4: Governance Standard 4 -- Suitability of Responsible People

[Governance Standard 4](http://www.acnc.gov.au/GovStd4) requires your
charity to take reasonable steps to be satisfied that its Responsible
People have not been
[disqualified](http://www.acnc.gov.au/disqualified):

- from managing a corporation under the *Corporations Act 2001* (Cth),
  or

- from being a Responsible Person in the previous 12 months by the
  ACNC Commissioner.

If your charity is not satisfied this is the case with a prospective
Responsible Person, it must not appoint that person. If they are already
serving as a Responsible Person, your charity must take reasonable steps
to remove them as a Responsible Person for the charity.

## Part 5: Governance Standard 5 -- Duties of Responsible People

[Governance Standard 5](http://www.acnc.gov.au/GovStd5) requires your
charity to take reasonable steps to ensure its Responsible People meet
specific duties (listed below), and that they understand the
responsibilities of their role. It is crucial that your Responsible
People know and thoroughly understand these duties.

The most common compliance risks that we see involve Governance Standard
5. These include concerns with identifying and managing conflicts of
interest, failure to address potential harm to beneficiaries, and
financial mismanagement.

It is the responsibility of your charity to take reasonable steps to
ensure its Responsible People comply with Governance Standard 5. The
steps will vary depending on your charity's particular circumstances.

Your charity must take reasonable steps to ensure that its Responsible
People understand and carry out the following duties:

-  **Governance Standard 5(a): Act with reasonable care and diligence**

> Your charity's Responsible People are in a position to guide and
> monitor the management of the charity. This duty requires Responsible
> People to be informed of the charity's activities, monitor its
> policies, understand its financial position, and to make adequately
> informed independent judgements on matters that come to them for
> decisions.

-  **Governance Standard 5(b): Act in good faith in the best interests
  of the charity and to further its purposes**

> Your charity's Responsible People must make decisions by honestly
> considering what would be in the best interests of the charity and
> further its charitable purposes. Where there is a potential or actual
> conflict of interest, your charity's Responsible People should put the
> charity's interests above their own interests.

-  **Governance Standard 5(c) and (d): Not misuse the position or
  information they gain as a Responsible Person**

> Your charity's Responsible People must not use their position, or
> information obtained through their position, to gain an advantage for
> themselves or someone else or to cause detriment to the charity.

-  **Governance Standard 5(e): Disclose any actual or perceived
  material conflicts of interest**

> Your charity's Responsible People must disclose any situation where
> they may appear to have a conflict between their duty to act in the
> best interests of the charity and a personal interest for themselves
> or someone else. They should not discuss or vote on any matter where
> there is such a conflict.

-  **Governance standard 5(f): Ensure the charity's financial affairs
  are managed responsibly**

> Your charity should have appropriate financial management systems,
> processes and procedures in place relative to its size, circumstances,
> and complexity of its financial affairs.

-  **Governance standard 5(g): Not allow a charity to operate while
  insolvent**

> Your charity's Responsible People must ensure that your charity can
> pay its debts when they are due. The Responsible People should
> regularly review the charity's financial position and ensure there are
> enough funds to pay for its activities. The charity must not take on
> new debts if it will not be able to pay its bills when they are due.
