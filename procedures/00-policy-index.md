## Policy index

<!-- Commit message

Turn this into an index

This file was previously a policy list from 2020. We can use it as an index for all policies. Change file names to remove punctuation and spaces as this does not play nice in all systems

-->

There is a requirement to review, and if needed, update the sub branch policies
and procedures. This is a big task. In order to spread the load you will note
below the titles of the 19 policies that the sub branch has, and alongside each
policy title I have inser the name of the committee member who is to conduct the
review of that policy.

In conducting your review please be guided by the following:

- is the policy relevant and does it make sense;

- does the policy and its associated procedure accurately reflect what we do;
  and

- if the policy or its associated needs amending or updating please see Dick who
  will facilitate the way ahead for you.

- [ ] Consider if we still need numbers for these policies given they can be
      electronic numbering makes it difficult to add or remove policies without
      confusion over precedence or importance
- [ ] Consider creating issue for each policy review and we get to them when we
      can
- [ ] Consider cataloguing with YAML metadata
- [ ] Automate this index later with something like
      [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/markdown-action-create-indexes)
- [ ] Expand this index to connect to SOPs from RSL NSW or ACNC for example
      (probably a good idea to split)
