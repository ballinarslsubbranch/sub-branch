**Plan for Review of Ballina RSL Policies**

**Patricia, Gentlemen,**

**There is a requirement to review, and if needed, update the sub branch
policies and procedures. This is a big task. In order to spread the load
you will note below the titles of the 19 policies that the sub branch
has, and alongside each policy title I have inserted the name of the
committee member who is to conduct the review of that policy.**

**Hard and soft copies of the these policies are held in the sub branch
office, please see Jimmy, Faith or Ted for guidance**

**In conducting your review please be guided by the following:**

- **is the policy relevant and does it make sense;**

- **does the policy and its associated procedure accurately reflect what
  we do; and**

- **if the policy or its associated needs amending or updating please
  see Ted or Dick who will facilitate the way ahead for you.**
