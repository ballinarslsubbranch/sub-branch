**Policy**: - **Quorums for Ballina RSL Sub-Branch Meetings**

A quorum is defined as the minimum number of voting members who must be
present at a properly called meeting in order to conduct business in the
name of the group

The purpose of a quorum rule is to give decisions made by a quorum
enough authority to allow binding action to be conducted.

A quorum should consist of “as large as can be depended upon for being
present at all meetings when the weather is not exceptionally bad”. In
other words, at best, a quorum is just an educated guess.

The Ballina RSL Sub-Branch has set the following numbers to establish a
quorum for meetings:

1.  At any Committee Meeting – minimum 5 Ballina RSL Sub-Branch
    financial elected committee members shall be a quorum.

2.  At a General Meeting – minimum of 20 Ballina RSL Sub-Branch
    financial members shall be a quorum.

3.  At any Annual or Extraordinary General Meeting called by the
    President or the Committee – minimum of 20 Ballina RSL Sub-Branch
    financial members shall be a quorum.

4.  At any Annual or Extraordinary General Meeting called on or by the
    requisition of members – minimum of 45 Ballina RSL Sub-Branch
    financial members shall be a quorum.

5.  At any Trustees Meeting – minimum of 2 Trustees

6.  Due to the rapid decline in membership due to age, the Annual
    General Meeting of the Ballina RSL Sub-Branch will consider and
    adjust the quorum if seen fit; the numbers required for the
    following years quorums.
