Governance Standard 5: Duties of Responsible Persons

This standard requires charities to take reasonable steps to make sure
that the following duties apply to responsible persons and that they
follow them. The duties can be summarised as follows:

to act with reasonable care and diligence

to act honestly and fairly in the best interests of the charity and for
its charitable purposes

not to misuse their position or information they gain as a responsible
person

to disclose conflicts of interest

to ensure that the financial affairs of the charity are managed
responsibly, and

not to allow the charity to operate while it is insolvent.

Generally, the duties mean that responsible persons should act with
standards of integrity and common sense.
