**Policy No.15 Statement**

**Statement of Purpose**

This statement is set forth to govern the management of the Ballina RSL
Sub-Branch investment portfolios. This is an area of particular
responsibility for the Ballina RSL Sub-Branch Committee and more
specifically its Trustees. The Trustees are called upon to exercise
appropriate oversight with respect to the prudent investment of the
Ballina RSL Sub-Branch’s assets in accordance with the long-term
objective of investing in assets compliant with the current RSL NSW
Constitution.

The Trustees responsibilities are:

1.  To establish broad guidelines for the investment of the portfolios’
    assets.

2.  To determine asset allocation targets and ranges (referred to as
    Protocols) that achieve the portfolios’ objectives.

3.  To select and monitor the performance of investment managers; and

4.  To take corrective action when it becomes apparent that objectives
    and guidelines are not being met, which includes the ability to
    terminate and hire new investment managers.

5.  To ensure that the assets are financially managed in the best
    interest of the members at an economical cost.

1)  **To establish broad guidelines for the investment of the
    portfolios’ assets**

> The overall objective of the assets is to preserve principle while
> seeking to maximize returns within acceptable levels of risk.
> Investments will be made to earn income and capital growth. The
> Ballina RSL Sub-Branch assets have the primary objective to provide
> annual earnings cash flow to meet the spending policy of the Ballina
> RSL Sub-Branch. Though the earnings of the portfolios’ are needed to
> meet short-term obligations, the portfolios’ themselves should be
> long-term in nature, as use of true endowment principle is restricted.
> (True Endowment: A true endowment refers to funds permanently
> restricted by donors, the courts, or by other authority to generate
> income for the nonprofit.
>
> The aim of income earned is to generate sufficient to meet the
> anticipated future spending needs for now and in the future. As part
> of this objective, the portfolios will be diversified across multiple
> asset classes and where applicable asset managers. The assets classes
> consist of cash, fixed interest, equities, property, and alternatives.
> (Hedge Funds/Absolute Return Funds/Infrastructure Investment
> Management/Real estate investment trusts). Other than cash,
> historically the returns on other asset classes can at times be
> somewhat volatile, and this has been taken into consideration when
> making asset allocation decisions.

2)  **To determine asset allocation targets and ranges (referred to as
    Protocols) that achieve the portfolios’ objectives**

> The Trustee will at all times act prudently to maximise the rate of
> return, subject to acceptable risk parameters, and maintenance of
> appropriate diversification across a broad range of assets.
>
> Having considered the Protocol of the Ballina RSL-Sub Branch and the
> needs and circumstances, the Ballina RSL-Sub Branch Trustees have
> adopted the following objectives for the investment of assets of the
> fund:

- To achieve an investment return (based on market values and net of tax
  and charges) that exceeds the CPI by at least 2-3% per annum when
  measured over a rolling 5 year period.

- to have a probability of 3 to less than 4 expected negative returns in
  any 20 year period\*; and

- to have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities as and when they fall
  due.

> \*The Standard Risk Measure (SRM) is based on industry guidance and is
> the estimated number of negative annual returns over any 20 year
> period. The SRM is not a complete assessment of investment risk, for
> instance it does not:

- detail the size a negative return could be or the potential for a
  positive return to be less than a member requires to meet their
  objectives

- capture the risk of the investment manager not meeting its investment
  objective, or

- take into account the impact of administration fees and tax, which
  would increase the chance of a negative return.

| **Risk Band** | **Risk Label** | **Estimated number of negative annual returns in any** **20-year** **period** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | Very low | Less than 0.5 |
| 2 | Low | 0.5 to less than 1 |
| 3 | Low to medium | 1 to less than 2 |
| 4 | Medium | 2 to less than 3 |
| 5 | Medium to high | 3 to less than 4 |
| 6 | High | 4 to less than 6 |
| 7 | Very high | 6 or greater |

> The Trustees may decide to utilize a multi-manager investment
> management system. If this is the case, each manager or management
> firm will be handling a portion of the portfolios that is consistent
> with its area of expertise and proven strengths.
>
> Assets will be diversified throughout a multitude of asset classes.
> The trustees have established basic asset allocation protocols within
> which the portfolio will be structured.
>
> The asset allocation protocols were developed by considering
> historical risk and return for the specific asset classes. The ‘target
> range’ is one that, historically, has produced investment results that
> are consistent with the portfolios’ goals and objectives. Through
> portfolio diversification, the portfolios are seeking to earn a
> competitive rate of return while assuming a reasonable level of risk.

|:----------------------|:----------------------:|:--------------------------:|

> The portfolio’s asset allocation should remain within the allowable
> ranges, while rebalancing back to the targets should occur at least
> annually. A report is to be prepared on a quarterly basis for the
> Ballina RSL Sub-Branch Trustees to review and the asset allocation
> will be reviewed at a minimum annually and appropriate action taken to
> realign assets back within the stated Protocols Target Range.

3)  **To select and monitor the performance of investment managers**

> The Ballina RSL Sub-Branch has decided to utilize one or more
> professional asset managers for the management of the investment
> assets. These assets are to be managed in a manner that would comply
> with the Protocols as stated in 2). The use of professional asset
> managers will not eliminate the oversight responsibility of the
> Ballina RSL Sub-Branch Trustees and the Committee.
>
> The Ballina RSL Sub-Branch Trustees may at their discretion appoint a
> Financial Planner/Consultant to assist with their asset management
> decisions. The Financial Planner/Consultant will provide reports to
> the Ballina RSL Sub-Branch Trustees on a quarterly basis. The reports
> are to include the following:

- Detailed transaction Report

- Performance Report

- Protocol Report

- Portfolio Valuation as at the end of the previous quarter.

- Distributed Income for the previous quarter

- Research Reports

> The Research reports include details of the investment which may
> include returns across a number of reporting periods, performance
> against a relative benchmark which could include a relative market
> index (e.g. ASX 200), company objective and profile.
>
> In addition to preserving the capital, maximizing performance, and
> monitoring the income generated, investment decisions must be
> consistent with the strategic direction of the Ballina RSL Sub-Brach
> and the RSL of Australia. This includes the Responsible Investment
> considerations listed below:

4)  **To take corrective action when it becomes apparent that objectives
    and guidelines are not being met, which includes the ability to
    terminate and hire new investment managers.**

> The Ballina RSL Sub-Branch Trustees will monitor and review the
> invested assets activities on a regular basis and to communicate with
> the Committee and members should they feel that any change in strategy
> is necessary in order to achieve the fund's objective.

5)  **To ensure that the assets are financially managed in the best
    interest of the members at an economical cost.**

> The costs of managing the assets should be competitive within the
> marketplace of similar investment portfolios. All fees, be they
> management related, or custody related, should be negotiated, and
> monitored to ensure that the Fund is not overpaying for services.
> Transactions fees, brokerage commissions, and security markup should
> be within the norms for institutional accounts of similar trading
> volume. It should be understood that best execution, at the lowest
> reasonable cost, is expected. Further, all reports to the Trustees
> will contain an explicit recording of all fees paid in relation to
> these investments.
