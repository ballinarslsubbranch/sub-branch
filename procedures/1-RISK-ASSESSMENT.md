**BALLINA RSL SUB-BRANCH**

**ANZAC DAY COMMEMORATIONS**

**RISK ASSESSMENT**

1.  **Introduction**

> Risk Management is supported by a methodology that involves
> establishing the risk context and of identifying, analysing and
> addressing risk issues. The approach should be to address Risk
> Management in a systematic manner with the aim of implementing
> cost-effective controls to minimise threats to the community and to
> reduce the potential for property loss, damage and personal injury.
>
> The Ballina Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) sub-Branch
> is required to demonstrate that measures have been taken to identify
> and assess foreseeable risks associated with Anzac Day commemorations
> and, where necessary ensure that adequate control measures are in
> place to mitigate these risks.
>
> This Risk Assessment provides the basis for the development of the
> Ballina RSL sub-Branch *Emergency Management Plan* for Anzac Day
> commemorations.

2.  **Background and Context**

> Anzac Day commemorations take place each year on 25 April and it is a
> time for the community to come together and pay tribute to the first
> ANZACs and to all the brave servicemen and women who have since
> followed in their footsteps. Anzac Day is the day Australia
> commemorates with services and marches in cities and towns to remember
> all those who lost their lives in service to their country.

1.  **The RSL and BALLINA**

> The RSL is a national organisation of returned and ex-servicemen and
> women formed to promote the interest of veterans and their families.
> The RSL New South Wales (NSW) Branch mission is about respecting,
> supporting and remembering our veterans and their families.
>
> The Ballina RSL is a sub-Branch of RSL NSW and is responsible for
> planning and managing the annual Anzac Day Commemorations conducted in
> Ballina, NSW.
>
> Ballina is a coastal town in northern NSW. The town is located in the
> Richmond Shire local government area, 738 kilometres north of the
> state capital, Sydney, and 186 kilometres south of Brisbane, QLD. At
> the 2016 Census, the urban area had a population of 24,852 people.

2.  **Anzac Day Ballina**

> The Ballina Anzac Day service is traditionally conducted at the RSL
> Memorial, Memorial Park on Grant Street, Ballina. Attendance at the
> Dawn service and the Commemoration and Wreath Laying service is
> expected to approximate 1,500 to 2,000 persons.

3.  **Purpose and Scope**

> The purpose of this Risk Assessment is to identify and assess credible
> risks that could adversely impact on the conduct of the Ballina Anzac
> Day commemorations and provide sufficient information that will
> support the development of an *Emergency Management Plan*.

4.  **Methodology**

> This is a simple Risk Assessment due to the limited nature and scope
> of the Ballina Anzac Day commemorations. The methodology used in this
> Risk Assessment is based on AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 (*Risk Management –
> Principles and Guidelines*) and is based on the steps outlined below.

1.  **Risk Identification**

> Potential risks were identified with an approach based on experience
> and brainstorming. The approach was to:

- Identify and list events and hazards that might happen, and

- Examine how and why an event could happen. This produced a list of
  events with possible causes and scenarios.

2.  **Risk Assessment**

> The approach then assess the likelihood and consequence of potential
> risks:

- Likelihood – how likely is an identified event to occur?

- Consequence – the outcome of an event or situation that could be a
  loss, damage or injury.

3.  **Risk Evaluation and Control**

> All identified risks were evaluated to determine which are tolerable
> and which require mitigation (treatment). A range of risk mitigation
> options were considered and were examined in terms of their likely
> effectiveness in risk reduction, practicality of implementation,
> overall cost and the expected benefits derived.
>
> Tables used for the evaluation of risk likelihood, consequence and
> risk evaluation are included at Annex A.

5.  **Risk Register**

> The Ballina Anzac Day commemoration activity Risk Register is at Annex
> B.

6.  **Risk Management**

> This Risk assessment provides the basis for the development of the
> Ballina RSL sub-Branch *Emergency Management Plan* for Anzac Day
> commemorations. This Risk Assessment should be reviewed on a regular
> basis to ensure that the proposed risk controls/treatment remain
> relevant and effective.
