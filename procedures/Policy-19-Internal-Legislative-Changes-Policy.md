**Procedures**: - **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch – Internal: Legislative
Changes Procedures**

Legislation and the general law:

- Legislation is written against the background of the general law

- The general law is the law that exists apart from legislation

- The general law consists of the common law and the principles of
  equity, which are applicable in NSW because of its history as a colony
  of the United Kingdom

- The general law emerged from the history of the United Kingdom and did
  not rely on laws made by Parliament for its existence

- The general law is commonly referred to as judge made law because it
  is found in decisions of judges on particular cases brought before
  them. However, generally speaking, the contemporary role of a judge is
  essentially to declare the existing general law, not to make a new law

- In Australia, only a Parliament may make legislation or authorise the
  making of legislation. However, because judges have a role of applying
  the laws of interpretation, if there is a dispute about the meaning of
  legislation, the judge decide the dispute

1.  The Ballina RSL Sub-Branch Executive and Committee are to:

    - keep up to date with any relevant changes to legislation that may
      affect the running of the Sub-Branch

    - follow any changes in the legislation which may apply to the way
      we conduct our business or provide goods and services to our
      clients

    - endeavour to keep at the forefront of technical knowledge in
      relation to OHS issues in the workplace

    - aim to keep up to date with any changes in regulations or codes of
      practice. This will be done by maintaining a close relationship
      with RSL State Branch, our local Council, Work Cover and the
      Department of Industrial Relations

2.  The Sub-Branch Secretary is to immediately advise the Committee of
    any Legislative changes notified to the Sub-Branch from any external
    source i.e. RSL NSW State Branch, Ballina Shire Council, ACNC, for
    the Committee to assess and action if necessary.
