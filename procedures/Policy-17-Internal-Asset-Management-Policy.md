**Internal: Asset Management Policy**

**Policy**: - **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch – Internal: Asset Management
Policy**

**Scope**

This Policy outlines the appropriate accounting measures and
administration of property, plant and equipment that is managed and
owned by the Ballina RSL Sub-Branch and applies to all staff of the
Ballina RSL Sub-Branch and its subsidiaries.

1.  **The Cost of an asset**

<!-- -->

1)  The initial cost of an asset includes, but is not limited to safety
    equipment to meet OHS requirements, training, freight and
    installation costs.

2)  The total cost of the new asset is not reduced by any benefit
    received from the trade-in of an asset. The cost of the new item and
    the trade-in value are to be recorded separately.

3)  The cost of an asset does not include items purchased for use in the
    repair or maintenance of the asset.

<!-- -->

2.  **Asset Register**

<!-- -->

1)  Capital assets and attractive items should be added to the
    Sub-Branch Asset Register.

2)  All items are to be given a system generated six-digit asset number
    when entered into the Sub-Branch Asset Register.

3)  Where practical on receipt of a capital asset or attractive item, a
    sticker *Property of the Ballina RSL Sub-Branch* should be affixed
    to the asset in a clearly visible position.

<!-- -->

3.  **Annual stocktake**

<!-- -->

1)  The annual stocktake provides an opportunity for the Sub-Branch to
    reconcile their asset register listings with the physical asset
    holdings, confirming the existence of assets listed and ensuring
    that the details and location of all assets are properly recorded.

2)  At the completion of the annual stocktake, an Asset Stocktake
    Confirmation form is required to be completed and submitted to be
    affixed to the Fixed Asset Register.

<!-- -->

4.  **Asset disposal**

<!-- -->

1)  Approval for disposal of capital assets and attractive items must be
    gained from the Sub-Branch Committee.

2)  Disposal of any Asset must conform to the NSW State Branch
    Constitution.

3)  For capital assets, the Sub-Branch Treasurer must complete an asset
    disposal form (Annex A) and update the assets register.

4)  For attractive items with an original cost less than \$3,000 (excl
    GST) the sub-Branch Treasurer must complete an asset disposal form,
    retain that form with the sub-Branch assets register for audit
    purposes and then update the assets register to record the disposal.

5)  Disposal forms are not required for assets not recorded on the
    Sub-Branch Asset Register. However the Sub-Branch Committee must
    ensure that the accepted methods of disposal as outlined in
    section e) are followed.

6)  The following are accepted methods of disposing of an asset (other
    than motor vehicles, refer to section 5):

- by tender to financial Ballina Sub-Branch members

- via a second-hand dealer or auctioneer

- by advertising in the general media, professional publications or
  websites

- if an acceptable offer is not received for serviceable items, then the
  item/s may

> be donated to institutions having similar aims to the RSL and not for
> profit organisations and charities on recommendation from the
> sub-Branch Committee. If an asset is donated, the asset disposal form
> must detail the advantage to the sub-Branch from the donation and how
> the benefit outweighs any financial return from the sale of the asset.

7)  If an offer from a tender by a financial Ballina Sub-Branch member
    is rejected in favour of a sale or donation to an external source,
    the reason must be documented on the asset disposal form.

<!-- -->

5.  **Motor vehicles**

<!-- -->

1)  Motor vehicles may be traded on a new vehicle or arrangements made
    to place the vehicle with an auction house.

2)  Via a second-hand dealer or auctioneer

3)  By advertising in the general media, professional publications or
    websites

4)  The desired sale price will be gauged midpoint of the trade-in price
    range for the particular make and model as detailed in the industry
    guide (Redbook) at the time of sale.

5)  The vehicle will be sold on an ‘as is’ basis. Any costs associated
    with the sale will be at the buyer’s expense.

<!-- -->

6.  **Sale of an asset**

<!-- -->

1)  For sales, payments must be cash, electronic transfer or bank
    cheque.

2)  The issuance of a tax invoice does not constitute payment.

3)  The trade-in of an asset requires the provision of a credit memo for
    the trade-in value to be processed with an invoice for the cost of
    the new asset purchase.

4)  The market value of the item must be documented and will be based on
    sources such as: previous sales, advertisements, newspapers and
    internet auction sites.

<!-- -->

7.  **Loss of an asset**

<!-- -->

1)  A lost asset is recorded as a disposal of nil value using an asset
    disposal form.

2)  Where applicable, the Sub-Branch Insurance Brokers may also need to
    be informed of an asset loss.

<!-- -->

8.  **Accounting for Sub-Branch assets**

<!-- -->

1)  Capitalised assets are displayed on the Sub-Branch balance sheet and
    depreciation on capitalised assets is recorded at the Sub-Branch
    level.

<!-- -->

9.  **Insurance**

<!-- -->

1)  The Sub-Branch has an extensive insurance program covering all
    sub-Branch owned assets and insurable liabilities regardless of
    location, however if an asset is on loan to a non-Sub-Branch entity
    it is expected that the receiving organisation will provide
    insurance for the asset while on loan.

<!-- -->

10. **Loan and hire of equipment**

<!-- -->

1)  A loan or hire arrangement involving the physical movement of an
    item must be approved, recorded and the Fixed Asset manager
    (Treasurer) informed in advance of the loan or hiring to ensure
    that:

- the asset register record for that item can be updated

- the insurance arrangements are in place where removed from the
  sub-Branch premises is contemplated

- any extra insurance cost is to be borne by the party to whom the
  item/s is loaned or hired

2)  Where the Sub-Branch does not have a clear title to the item to be
    loaned or hired (e.g. it was loaned to the Sub-Branch), the written
    approval of the owner is to be obtained prior to the arrangement of
    the item concerned, unless the item is to be loaned or hired to
    another Sub-Branch for a use consistent with the original intentions
    of the grantor.

3)  The hiring rate is dependent on whether the hirer is internal or
    external to the sub-Branch. The following guidelines apply to the
    hiring rate:

- Items hired internally should reflect reasonable recovery of
  maintenance and other operating costs, but not capital costs unless
  the intention at the time the item was purchased, including hiring to
  achieve capital cost recovery.

- Items hired to external hirers should reflect reasonable recovery of
  total costs. A daily rate determined by dividing the capital cost of
  the item by 150 is suggested as a guide only.
