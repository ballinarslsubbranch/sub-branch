#### **Emergency Plan**

Date: Date of last revision:

*\[Where working operations have changed as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, emergency plans must be reviewed and, if necessary,
updated.\]*

## Scope and application

*\[Set out the scope and application of your emergency plan.*

*Identify the kind of emergency events and occurrences that your event /
activity could experience, such as fire, chemical spills, bomb threats,
electrical outages, security breaches, natural disasters, significant
injuries, medical events and pandemics. You may wish to include a
specific scenario of a worker being diagnosed with COVID-19.*

*Explain how the emergency plan gets activated.\]*

## Emergency contacts

*\[List your local emergency services here as well as useful workplace
contacts such as wardens, first aid officers and the like, and other
emergency contacts relevant to your business. If you work in close
proximity to other businesses it can be helpful to include their contact
details here too, in case they need to be notified of an emergency that
may affect them.\]*

## Emergency management team -- roles and responsibilities

*\[Outline the roles and responsibilities of your emergency management
team. Your emergency management team may include your wardens, first aid
officers and others. Explain each person's responsibilities both in an
emergency and in planning for an emergency. This can include specific
instructions for each person, if relevant. For example, you might
outline the training and planning procedures that are required for a
fire warden.\]*

## Supervisors -- roles and responsibilities

*\[Outline the roles and responsibilities of supervisors both in an
emergency and in planning for an emergency.\]*

## Workers -- roles and responsibilities

*\[Outline the roles and responsibilities of workers both in an
emergency and in planning for an emergency.\]*

## Evacuation procedures

*\[Outline your evacuation procedures here. You should include a copy of
your floor plan with detailed locations of emergency exits, evacuation
routes, safety equipment and locations of wardens clearly marked. If you
have workers across multiple locations, ensure procedures are outlined
for everyone.\]*

## Emergency procedures 

*\[Set out procedures for the potential emergency events and occurrences
you have identified for your activity/ event, based on the hazards in
your workplace and location. These could include fire, chemical spills,
bomb threats, electrical outages, security breaches, natural disasters,
significant injuries, medical events and pandemics. You may wish to
include a specific scenario of a worker being diagnosed with COVID-19.*

*Your plan must outline who should be contacted and at what stages, and
the best means of contact.*

*Outline medical treatment options -- i.e. where to find emergency kits,
first aid officers and supplies and instructions. Make sure you consider
how you will account for people with disability or specific needs in the
case of an emergency.*

*If you need to provide for a large number of scenarios, you may choose
to include only a brief outline of procedures in the document and refer
to another document/s that contains more detailed information on the
procedure for each scenario.*

*Consider whether precautions you have taken as a result of COVID-19 may
affect your risks and procedures -- i.e. if key personnel are no longer
working from their usual workplace, or if there are less staff to
undertake key tasks. Physical distancing measures may also affect how
easily workers can communicate in an emergency situation, so ensure you
consider these factors when reviewing your plan.\]*

## After an emergency

*\[Include information on what should be done after an emergency has
occurred, including who must be notified and how and when this should
occur. You may wish to include a template for recording the incident and
outline the debriefing process to review what happened, how the plan was
followed and lessons learned.*

*If staff are working from different locations, including from home,
make clear what is expected for an emergency that occurs outside of the
usual workplace. This may be particularly relevant during the COVID-19
pandemic.\]*

## Testing the emergency plan

*\[Your emergency plan must include information on how and how often
your procedures will be tested -- i.e. evacuation drills, fire alarm
testing.\]*

## Training 

*\[Your emergency plan must include information on the provision of
information, training and instruction to workers on their roles and
responsibilities in implementing procedures.*

*If your work processes change, you may require new or additional
information or training. For example, some workplaces will have
undergone significant changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\]*

## Reviewing, reporting and record-keeping

*\[Your emergency plan should detail how you will review, report on, and
what records will be kept on, emergency responses and on compliance with
the plan.*

*Emergency plans should be developed and reviewed in consultation with
workers.*

*If you have a shared workplace (i.e. a construction site, office
building), then you must also consult, cooperate and coordinate
activities with all other persons who have a work health or safety duty
in relation to the same matter, so far as is reasonably practicable.
This includes when preparing, reviewing and revising emergency plans.
You may have a shared emergency plan in place if applicable.\]*
