1.  **Fire Safety Certificate**

A Fire Safety Certificate is a certificate issued by or on behalf of the
owner of a building to certify that essential fire safety measures have
been installed to the approved standard as specified in the Fire Safety
Schedule for the building.

2.  **Fire Safety Schedule**

The Fire Safety Schedule forms part of the Fire Safety Certificate
listing the essential fire safety measures implemented in the hole of
the building which must satisfy the standard of performance listed in
the Schedule and includes the routine servicing frequency and
tolerances.

3.  **Owner Responsibility**

Once a Fire Safety Certificate is issued, there is a legal
responsibility on the land owner to ensure that any fire protection
measures within the building are maintained so that they are capable of
performing to a prescribed standard should a fire event take place. This
responsibility cannot be contracted out to a tenant, an agent may act on
the ownerâ€™s behalf, however the owner retains all of the legal
responsibilities under the Regulations.

4.  **Annual Fire Safety Statement**

The Annual Fire Safety Statement is a statement issued by or on behalf
of the owner of a building to the effect that each fire safety measure
specified in the Fire Safety Certificate has been assessed by a properly
qualified person and was found when it was assessed to be capable of
performing to the standard as specified in the Fire Safety Schedule. The
standard of maintenance is usually a reference to an Australian Standard
for maintenance of the fire safety measure.
