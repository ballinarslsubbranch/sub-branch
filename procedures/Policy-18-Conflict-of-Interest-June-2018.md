**Policy - Conflict of Interest Policy**

**Policy:** Conflict of Interest Policy

> **1. Purpose**
>
> The purpose of this policy is to assist the Executives and Trustees of
> **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch** to effectively identify, disclose and
> manage any actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest in
> order to protect the integrity of **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch** and
> manage risk.
>
> **2. Objective**
>
> The **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch** Executives and Trustees aim to ensure
> that all members are aware of their obligations to disclose any
> conflicts of interest that they may have, and to comply with this
> policy to ensure they effectively manage those conflicts of interest
> as representatives of **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch**.
>
> **3. Scope**
>
> This policy applies to Executives and Trustees and all Members of
> **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch** and those approved and appointed from time
> to time for specific undertakings.
>
> **4. Definition of conflicts of interests**
>
> A conflict of interest occurs when a person’s personal interests
> conflict with their responsibility to act in the best interests of the
> charity. Personal interests include direct interests as well as those
> of family, friends, or other organisations a person may be involved
> with or have an interest in. It also includes a conflict between an
> Executive’s, Committee’s, Trustees’ and member’s duty to **Ballina RSL
> Sub-Branch** and other duties that the Executive, Committee, Trustees
> and members have to another charity or organisations. A conflict of
> interest may be actual, potential or perceived and may be financial or
> non-financial.
>
> These situations present the risk that a person will make a decision
> based on, or affected by, these influences, rather than in the best
> interests of the charity and must be managed accordingly.
>
> **5. Policy**
>
> This policy has been developed because conflicts of interest commonly
> arise, and do not need to present a problem to the charity if they are
> openly and effectively managed. It is the policy of the **Ballina RSL
> Sub-Branch** as well as a responsibility of the Executive, Committee,
> Trustees and members, that ethical, legal, financial or other
> conflicts of interest be avoided and that any such conflict, where
> they do arise, does not conflict with the obligations to **Ballina RSL
> Sub-Branch**.
>
> **Ballina RSL Sub-branch** will manage conflicts of interest by
> requiring Executive, committee, Trustees and members to:

- avoid conflicts of interest where possible

- identify and disclose any conflicts of interest

- carefully manage any conflicts of interest, and

- follow this policy and respond to any breaches.

> **5.1 Responsibility of the Executive.**
>
> The Executive is responsible for:

- establishing a system for identifying, disclosing and managing
  conflicts of

interest across the charity

- monitoring compliance with this policy, and

- reviewing this policy on an annual basis to ensure that the policy is

operating effectively.

> The Executive must ensure that all members are aware of the ACNC
> governance standards, particularly Governance Standard 5, and that
> they disclose any actual or perceived material conflicts of interests
> as required by Governance Standard 5 and the ACNC Managing Conflict of
> Interest Guide.
>
> **5.2 Identification and disclosure of conflicts of interest**
>
> Once an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest is
> identified, it must be entered into **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch’s**
> Register of Interests (RI), as well as being raised with the
> Executive. Where all of the other members share a conflict, the
> Executive should refer to Governance Standard 5 to ensure that proper
> disclosure occurs. The Register of Interests must be maintained by
> **The Honorary Secretary**, and record information related to a
> conflict of interest, including the nature and extent of the conflict
> of interest and any steps taken to address it.
>
> **Confidentiality of disclosures**
>
> The **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch’s** RI will be restricted to Executive
> and Committee members only. It will also be available to the
> **Sub-Branch’s Auditor**, during an audit period, for audit purposes.
> Where it has been requested by **RSL NSW State Branch** it will be
> released to the specified individual/organisation only. In the event
> of an investigation of the **Ballina RSL Sub-Branch,** it will be
> released to the appointed investigator.
>
> **6. Action required for management of conflicts of interest**
>
> **6.1 Conflicts of interest of all members**
>
> Once the conflict of interest has been appropriately disclosed, the
> **Executive**, excluding the member disclosing and any other
> conflicted member, must decide whether or not those conflicted members
> should:

- vote on the matter (this is a minimum),

- participate in any debate, or

- be present in the room during the debate and the voting.

> In exceptional circumstances, such as where a conflict is significant
> or likely to prevent a member from regularly participating in
> discussions, it may be considered whether it is appropriate for the
> person conflicted to resign from the **Executive, Committee or
> Trustee** positions.
>
> **6.2 What should be considered when deciding what action to take**

- In deciding what approach to take, the Executive will consider whether
  the

conflict needs to be avoided or simply documented

- whether the conflict will realistically impair the disclosing person’s
  capacity to

impartially participate in decision-making

- alternative options to avoid the conflict

- the charity’s objects and resources, and

- the possibility of creating an appearance of improper conduct that
  might impair

confidence in, or the reputation of, the Ballina RSL Sub-Branch.

> The approval of any action requires the agreement of at least a
> majority of the Executives and Committee, excluding any conflicted
> member/s of the Executive and Committee who are present and voting at
> the meeting. The action and result of the voting will be recorded in
> the minutes of the meeting and in the Register of Interests.
>
> **7. Compliance with this policy**
>
> If the Executive, Committee or a member has a reason to believe that a
> person subject to the policy has failed to comply with it, the matter
> is to be reported to an Executive officer and the circumstances are to
> be investigated.
>
> If it is found that this person has failed to disclose a conflict of
> interest, the Executive or Committee may take action against that
> person in accordance with RSL NSW Constitution, Bylaws and Regulations
> in force at the time; or
>
> If it is found to be of such a serious nature, the Executive will
> refer the matter to the NSW Police Force for further investigation.
>
> If a person suspects that a member has failed to disclose a conflict
> of interest, they must discuss this with the person in question for
> clarification and immediately notify the Executives or Committee of
> their concerns. The Executive or Committee shall discuss the conflict
> of interest at its next meeting and record details of the outcome in
> the Minutes. At the meeting the Secretary is to produce the Conflicts
> of Interest Register to confirm or otherwise, the conflict.
>
> **Contacts**
>
> For questions about this policy, please contact the Honorary Secretary
> by email at <secretary@ballinasubbranch.org> or in writing.
