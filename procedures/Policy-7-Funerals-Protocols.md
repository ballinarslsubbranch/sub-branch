    by the Committee each year when compiling the annual budget.

6.  The member delivering the service funeral tribute is to familiarise
    himself with the RSL NSW poppy protocol which is as follows:-

<!-- -->

1)  As part of the RSL Funeral Tribute, as a tradition, special poppies
    are laid by serving or ex-service personnel. Unfortunately this
    tradition has become somewhat eroded by many non service persons who
    are unaware of the deep service significance attached to the laying
    of poppies at the funeral.

2)  While family members should not be denied the opportunity to place
    poppies if they request, the RSL would prefer that another form of
    respect be shown such as the laying of flower petals to be used by
    the family and non service personnel.

3)  Poppies will normally be available at the funeral home. Members
    conducting tribute, should check' and if not available the secretary
    is to arrange alternative supply if possible. Provision of poppies
    at the service will be managed by the member delivering the RSL
    tribute in consultation with the funeral director.

<!-- -->

7.  The sub-Branch Secretary is to ensure that there are sufficient
    Australian Flags for presentation to the families. Flags are
    available from the local Federal Member.
