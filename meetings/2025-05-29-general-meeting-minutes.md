Motion: that $200 per month be approved for well-being support to the *healthy hearts* swimming programme for their refreshments and program promotion, and that the continuotion and amount be reviewed as required.

The registered members of the Heartly Health Programme, who meet twice a week as swimming physiotherapy group as part of their ongoing health and wellness activities, request a monthly maximum allocation of $20O to cover the cost of refreshments during their sessions.

The amount requested is modest and will directly benefit active registered health heart members.

Since this motion was resolved, the past management have exceeded the limited number, currently Ballia twenty three Affiliiate members, the number has been exceeded while potential members have been denied their application.
