## Background

This repo is kind of a working document but also the start of what could be the production version. It would collect things together for what we have been discussing in email and in chats. These are issues that are not easy to "discuss" by email and it has been difficult to get us all together. github is a software collaboration platform that is mainly used for code development, which is a massive, international effort that can be done at the same time by multiple people working on many files. We have a much smaller scale of albeit very important work to do but also scant resources to do that work.

This repo is public but we could create an organisation and make private repositories for other work. There are plenty of tools that can be used to edit plain text files, most of them free and plain text is not going anywhere. Some of this is covered in this [document](decision-record/why-use-github.md)

## Decision record

An architecture decision record is a place where decisions are recorded on the direction of a software development project. We could use our own [decision record](decision-record) for the direction of the sub-Branch. It is transparent, changes are recorded and it is open for members to contribute. The first "decision" recorded there is on why to use [github](decision-record/why-use-github.md)

## Correspondence register

We need to register correspondence for the sub-Branch. The [correspondence register](/correspondence-register) is a place to do that. The [correspondence](/correspondence-register/correspondence.md) file shows several examples of how we can record correspondence, either in one big file, by linking to others or to an external register hosted elsewhere such as in SharePoint or on our website.

## Meetings

For meetings to run smoothly, we need to collaboartively develop agendas. There is an agenda [template](agenda-template.md), taken directly from SOP 3 from the RSL. This could be used as a template for each meeting and we could most the draft [meeting minutes](/minutes.md) immediately after the meeting is finished, with the ability for everyone to review before they are accepted at the next meeting.
