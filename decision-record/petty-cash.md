# No longer using petty cash for payment

At the Executive meeeting on 3 December 2025, the Executive agreed that petty cash is no longer required as it presents an unnecessary risk for poor accounting, for example, if reasons for use are not provided with receipts. The executive agreed to run the current cash down to zero and pay future expenses with the sub-Branch credit card or by reimbursement.
