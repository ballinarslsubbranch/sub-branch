## Background

> This decision record is based on the concept of an _architecture_ decision record from software design. In our context, it is a _decision_ record to enable asynchronous, transparent discussion of issues and form a record of why those decisions were made for the Ballina RSL sub-Branch

Inspiration comes from Tris Oaten and his noboilerplate YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/WgV6M1LyfNY?si=2_TLl5muax3nlNX3) highlighting the [unreasonable effectiveness of plain text teams](https://github.com/0atman/noboilerplate/blob/main/scripts/34-Plain-Text-Team.md)

[Example decision record](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main)

Reason for requirement is based on limited handover and difficult to navigate SharePoint site that has multiple files and no easy to navigate structure.

## Discussion
Propose to use github for decision record as first iteration
Scale to agendas, minutes and correspondence
Work with web provider to integrate or determine is wordpress can be used as well or instead given that there are integrations available
Created correspondence register already in SharePoint to register correspondence

We can create a Ballina sub-Branch github organisation for free and a mono-repo

### Pros
- Scalable
- Massive open source support
- permanence
- lightweight text documents
- easy to replicate
- works on any system, including mobile

### Cons
- "Techy" solution
- Privacy or confidentiality concerns
- Duplication of effort
- Multiple systems
- Communicating externally

## Next steps

- [ ] Consider templates
- [ ] Relate an issue for discussion
- [ ] Consider what we use github for
