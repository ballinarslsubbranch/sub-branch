# M365 non-profit licences

Microsoft has announced that they are discontinuing the _free grant (donated)_ version of Microsoft 365 Business Premium for nonprofits. As of **July 1, 2025**, renewals of these free licenses are no longer available. Since your organisation's renewal date isÂ **October 27, 2025**, this change will apply at that time. 

From renewal, your current free Business Premium licenses will be replaced by **discounted nonprofit licenses**. These will still include all the features you use today, but at a **75% discount from commercial pricing** rather than being free.

Sub-Branch decided to keep the following licences, invoiced monthly:

- President (office holder)

- VP (office holder)

- VP2 (office holder)

- Treasurer (office holder)

- Secretary (office holder)

- Office - for office admin

- Accounts - to keep admin and accounts separate in case the roles are separated later
